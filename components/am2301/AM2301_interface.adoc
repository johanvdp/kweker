=== Interface

The bus signal is a single wire shared for in- and output by both the host and the device.
Both parties use open-drain type outputs to pull-down the signal from the floating (pulled-high) signal level.

* Phase 1: Host start
** Host pulls the signal low (Tbe)
** Host floats the signal high
* Phase 2: device response
** Device pulls the signal low (Trel)
** Device floats the signal high (Treh)
* Phase 3: device exchanges bits (40x)
** Device pulls the signal low (Tlow)
** Device floats the signal high  (Thi0, or Thi1)
** Bit is interpreted as low (0) when Thi < Tlow
** Bit is interpreted as high (1) when Thi > Tlow
* Phase 4: device release
** Device drives the signal high  (Thi0, or Thi1)

=== Software decoding

This software decodes the incoming signal using the following state model.
