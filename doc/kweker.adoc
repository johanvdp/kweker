=== Cause and effect

How a positive increase in one phenomenon affects another.

* (+) causes an increase
* (-) causes a decrease
* effect depends on environment

== Control

=== Light

The light is not a means of control. It is strictly following the night/day circadian rhythm that was set.
The heat of the light does have an effect on temperature and thus humidity of the environment.

.Cause and effect
* ON
    ** Increase temperature
    ** Decrease relative humidity (higher temperature)
    ** Increase relative humidity (more evaporation)
    ** Reduce CO2 concentration (photosynthesis)
* OFF
    ** Decrease temperature
    ** Increase relative humidity (lower temperature)
    ** Decrease relative humidity (less evaporation)

.Light control
|===
| Condition | Result

2+| *control off*
2+| *control manual*
2+| *control automatic*

| circadian day | ON
| circadian night | OFF
|===

=== Exhaust fan

Reduces the humidity (produced by evaporation through leaves) to avoid mold.
Follows the ambient temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration.

.Cause and effect
* ON
    ** Follow ambient temperature
    ** Follow ambient humidity
    ** Follow ambient CO2 concentration
* OFF
    ** Increase temperature (if light is on, producing heat)
    ** Increase humidity (evaporation)
    ** Reduce CO2 concentration (if light is on, photosynthesis)

.Exhaust fan control
[%autowidth]
|===
| Condition | Result

| Temperature high | ON
| Humidity high | ON
| CO2 concentration high | ON
| else | OFF
|===

=== Recirculation fan

.Cause and effect
* ON
    ** Promote stirdy stem growth
    ** Promote nutrient transport by promoting evaporation
    ** Plant produces more flowers where wind blows
    ** Disperse CO2 that is needed on the leaves, not on the ground
    ** Equalize temperature
* OFF
    ** No energy use

=== Heater

Avoid low temperature, and avoid mold.
