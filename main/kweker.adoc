== Control

=== Lamp

The lamp is not a means of control. It is strictly following the night/day circadian rhythm that was set.

.Cause and effect
* ON
    ** Increase air temperature (lamp).
    ** Decrease relative humidity (higher temperature)
    ** Increase relative humidity (more evaporation)
    ** Reduce CO2 concentration (photosynthesis)
* OFF
    ** Decrease air temperature (lamp)
    ** Increase relative humidity (lower temperature)
    ** Decrease relative humidity (less evaporation)

=== Exhaust fan

Reduces the humidity (produced by evaporation through leaves) to avoid mold.
Follows the ambient air temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration.

.Cause and effect
* ON
    ** Follow ambient air temperature
    ** Follow ambient air humidity
    ** Follow ambient air CO2 concentration
* OFF
    ** Increase air temperature (if lamp is on)
    ** Increase air humidity (evaporation)
    ** Reduce CO2 concentration (if lamp is on, photosynthesis)

=== Recirculation fan

.Cause and effect
* ON
    ** Promote stirdy stem growth
    ** Promote nutrient transport by promoting evaporation
    ** Plant produces more flowers where wind blows
    ** Disperse CO2 that is needed on the leaves, not on the ground
* OFF
    ** No energy use

=== Heater

Avoid low temperature, and avoid mold.

** list: Cause and effect **

* ON
    ** Increase temperature
    ** Decrease relative humidity
